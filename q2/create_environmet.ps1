conda create --name py3vDev python=3.11.4
# Adding “python” to the command creates a copy of the python
# interpreter in the environment.  This helps with automatic
# configuration of some tools.  For example, VS Code will only detect
# a conda environment automatically if it contains a copy of the
# interpreter.

conda activate py3vDev
