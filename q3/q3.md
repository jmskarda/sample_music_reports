# Question 3

Describe how you would write a short program which connects to a database of your choice, retrieves records from a table named “Customers” with the Last Name “Johnson”, and writes out the First Name, Last Name, and Age to a text file named “Johnson.txt”. If you prefer, you may write Python code directly, or a mixture of description and code.

## Answer

Steps:

1. Install SQLAlchemy to the python environment definition
   - Also install an provider library for the specific DB
2. Assemble a JDBC or ODBC connection string
3. Connect to the database using SQLAlchemy and the connection string
4. Execute the following SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     first_name
     , last_name
     , age
   FROM customers
   WHERE
     Last_name = 'Johnson'
   ```

5. Write the recordset to a text file, probably using a tool like Pandas
   to automatically format it as a CSV.
